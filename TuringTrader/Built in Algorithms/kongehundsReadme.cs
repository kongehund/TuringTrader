// This folder was manually added to the solution in order to enable Visual Studio's common tools,
// such as "Go To Definition", hovering over Classes or methods to view their documentation, etc.

// When you open the files in this folder from the solution explorer, those tools will work.
// If you open the files from the TuringTrader app, however, or from the default Algorithms folder, 
// the tools will not work.

// So basically, the files in this folder are just copies of the files found in the default Algorithms path

// There might be a better solution to this problem, but I don't know what that solution would be.
